## A Graveyard for Dreams

...is a yet another pixelart metroidvania for web browsers. That's all.

This git repo includes the source ~~code~~ spaghetti for the game.

### Links to binary releases

Haha binary it's an Html5 games

-----

### Links to somewhere where I can play the game?!

Sure, here's a few:

- [Game Jolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/a-graveyard-for-dreams/544951)

- [Itch.io](https://jani-nykanen.itch.io/a-graveyard-for-dreams)

### Cooking the spaghetti

Even though raw spaghetti might be tasty, you may want to ~~compile~~ cook it first. Closure compiler is included in the repo, so just type `make dist` to build & optimize the code and pack it into a zip file. `dist.zip` is created.

### IT'S SO UGLY!

I know. My goal was to make "self-commenting code", that is, code so clear I don't need comments. That didn't happen. And it has barely any comments. Sorry.

-----

### License

Good question. I'll update this later. Feel free to play with the code, fork it and stuff, just don't do any commercial products with it. And it would be nice if you gave credit. I don't recommend using the art assets anywhere, but if you really have to, make sure it's not a commercial product and you must give a credit.
